#' growthcurve: A package for the analysis of biological growth curves
#' 
#' The growthcurve package provides functions for analyzing biological growth
#' curves. growthcurve is currently a wrapper for the \pkg{grofit} package
#' with a focus on incorporating growth curve analysis into modern R workflows.
#' These functions only work with data stored in data frames or compatible
#' objects. Eventually, this package will become independent of \pkg{grofit},
#' allowing for increased functionality.
