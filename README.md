# growthcurve

growthcurve is an [R](http://r-project.org) package for analyzing biological growth curves.
It is designed to integrate into modern workflows, allowing it to be used in conjunction with powerful tools like [dplyr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) and [magrittr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/index.html).

This package is currently a wrapper for the powerful [grofit](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/grofit/index.html) package, which is no longer being developed.
This is temporary, as I plan to eventually make growthcurve an independent tool with more flexibility.


## Installation

`growthcurve` is not quite ready to be available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org), but you can use [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) to install the current development version:

    if(!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
    devtools::install_github('briandconnelly/growthcurve')


## Examples

Coming soon...
